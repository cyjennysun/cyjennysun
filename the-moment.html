			<p>It was late at night, and I was on my way home, exhausted. There was a father and a son walking in front of me, sharing a secret with each other.</p> <br/>
			        <p> Son: Don't tell mommy. She'll be mad.</p><br/>
			        <p> Dad: Okay, I won't tell mommy. But promise me you won't do it again? </p><br/>
			<p>The son nods his head and lifts up his hand to hold his father's hand.</p> <br/>

			<p>Listening their entire conversation, I somehow felt empowered. I pondered. Sometimes, the simpliest thing is the most beautiful thing. Isn't it? </p><br/>

			<p>This is the backstory of this short film. I wanted to show that even though you're having a bad day, lifts up your head! You'll see love. And I believe love is contagious.</p> <br/>

			<p>I directed, wrote, filmed, and edited this short film.</p>
