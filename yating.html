                                    <p>Since I have never used the app before, I started off by becoming a new user myself and getting familiar with the original design. As I went through the entire process which included downloading, on-boarding, discovering, and learning, I took notes about <b>what were confusing</b> and <b>where I paused</b>. From the notes, I drafted a list of usability problems with heuristic violations and rated each of them based on severity. The problems include both design and technical ones, here I present key findings regarding experience design. </p>

                                    <p><b>1.</b>
                                           Users cannot switch to a different language within YaTing keyboard. Thus, they have to shuffle through other keyboards until they come back to YaTing.
                                    </p>


                                    <p><b>2.</b>
                                           Slider on the top of the keyboard is confusing. No hint or help is provided.

                                           The process of enabling the keyboard was a little confusing because there was a lack of visual cue and the instructions relied heavily on recall rather than recognition.

                                    <br/> 
                                    <p>For voice typing specifically, I found two interesting aspects that have been mentioned multiple times.</p>

                                    <br/> 
                                    
									<p><b>1.</b> Even with voice typing, people still need to check whether the spelling is right. It can be a little distracting when they are multitasking. Thus, sometimes voice typing doesn’t make things easier. </p> 

									<p><b>2.</b> Going along with the first bulleted point, when there’s an error, it is more difficult to correct because people either need to move the cursor to where the mistakes are or deleting everything backwards up until they hit the mistakes. </p>  

									<br/>

									<p>Therefore, I decided to experiment two new designs and see if they will possibly work. First, a <b><font color="#FF9671">Text to Speech</font></b> function that reads the texts that have been entered by voice, right after the users are done with their input. Second, a <b><font color="#FF9671">delete all button</font></b> that quickly deletes the last sentence entirely. </p>

                                    <p>In order to validate these ideas, I explained to the engineer about how these two design will work. The engineer was able to prototype the design for me to test with potential users. </p>
                                    
                                    <br/>

									<br/>

									<p>To understand users’ thoughts and needs, I conducted <b>8</b> short interviews followed by a usability test using the original version of the app. In the usability tests, I designed 4 tasks that asked participants to perform essential functions. Three main goals for the interviews and tests are to <b>observe users’ behavior</b>, <b>validate heuristic validations</b> that was done earlier, and <b>test new design ideas</b> for voice typing.</p>

									<p> For the test result, unfortunately, the new design ideas did not work out. However, some other problems have been identified.</p>

                                    <br/>

                                    <p>From the interviews and usability tests, two main problems emerged.</p>

                                    <br/>

                                    <p><b>1. Users don’t use the “microphone button” shortcut to switch to voice typing. </b></p> 

                                    <br/>
                                    <p><font color="#FF9671" size="6"><b>"</font></b> Wait I didn’t even notice there was a shortcut.<font color="#FF9671" size="6"><b>"</font></b>
                                    </p>

                                    <br/>
                                    <p>When users were asked to switch from Chinese keyboard to voice typing, no one used the shortcut mic icon on the upper right corner because they didn’t even notice it. Thus, they had to keep pressing the earth icon to circle through all the keyboards to get to voice typing. From my observation, there are two reasons that caused the problem:
                                    </p>
                             

                                    <p><b>a.</b> The icon is not prominent. </p>
									   
									<p><b>b.</b> Since the first thing that the users ever see in the app is the voice typing
									   screen, and the only way they can switch from voice to Chinese/English keyboard is to click the earth icon. Thus, it created a mental model that they can only use the earth icon to switch typing methods.
									</p>

                                    <br/>  
                                    <p>It was a valuable experience working with engineers and visual designer. I learned the importance of <b>utilizing the data and result from the interviews to explain design rationale</b> to the engineer.
                                    </p>

                                    <br/>  
                                    <p>From this experience, I was glad that we tested new concepts early in the process. <b>Failing early rather than later</b> gave me an idea of what users really need and want. Most importantly, identifying what doesn’t work early would also save lots of manpower and time later on in the process.
