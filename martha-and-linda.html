			<br/>
			<p>Martha and Linda had been partners for 11 years. In 2004, Martha was diagnosed with ALS, a disease that weakens muscles and causes difficulty in speaking and moving. Although Martha's journey with ALS was not easy, she had a dream. She dreamt of visiting Japan and teaching little kids English there.</p><br/>
			<p>This short documentary captures Martha's love for Japan and her story with Linda. Collaborating with Swan Songs, a non-profit organization that provides last musical wishes, Martha enjoyed a Japanese concert brought to her by a young violin musician, Laoise Matsumoto.</p> <br/>

			<p>Martha was not only a passionate teacher, but also a loving partner with a brave and beautiful soul. This film is for her, Linda, and their family. </p><br/>


			<p>I directed, filmed(along with Rajinee Buquing), and edited this short documentary.</p>
