			<p>Babe is a 100-year-old lady who likes to pat people on the buttom. When you see Babe, it's hard to tell that she's 100 years old because she's so cheerful and always makes people laugh. Babe used to be a volunteer at a church. She enjoyed helping people and serving GOD.</p>

			<p>I directed, filmed(along with Rachel Bardin), and edited this short documentary. </p>
